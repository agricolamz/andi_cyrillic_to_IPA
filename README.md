# Andi transliteration
This is a TECkit map for the Bulk editor in SIL FieldWorks. It can also be used in SIL Converters. It uses the Andi alphabet (e. g. see [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/andi.htm)), with several additions:

*  <1>, \<I\> (U+0049, Latin Capital letter I) or <ӏ> (U+04CF, [ Cyrillic small letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)) can be used instead of <Ӏ> (U+04C0, [Cyrillic letter Palochka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka)).
* [je] following a vowel or in word-initial position should be written as <йе>.
* The uvular voiced stop ɢ is expected to be written in Cyrillic as <кгъ>, as in the work of Kh. Salimov. However, for convenience purposes when transcribing texts written under other conventions (such as The Gospel of Luke), the sequence <гъгъ> is also treated in this script as IPA ɢ.
* Nasal vowels are written with a tilde over it (e. g. <а̃>, <я̃>) or with a <2> following the vowel (e. g. <а2>, <и2>).
* The sequence <лъ> by default is ambiguous. We decided to use <лЪ> or <ЛЪ> to denote a lateral fricative [ɬ] and <л.ъ> to denote sequences composed of a lateral approximant and a glottal stop [lʔ].
